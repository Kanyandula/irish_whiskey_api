            "review": "This rare and exclusive 19-year-old single malt from High N' Wicked was bottled from one of five single barrels of various proofs. The nose is filled with tropical fruit, particularly pineapple and mango, with subtle notes of light brown sugar following. On the palate, the whiskey is deep and complex, with a long-lasting finish that kicks in notes of dried fruit, malt, and chocolate. All of the casks for this single-barrel limited edition line came from the personal collection of celebrated distiller Noel Sweeney, making this an almost once-in-a-lifetime opportunity for a handful of whiskey collectors (with no budget constraints).",

While the jury remains (mainly) out on the topic of terroir in spirits, this whiskey has a distinctive profile and basically tastes like nothing else in the category. Its aromas scream of summer berries and succulent fruit, while botanical undertones bring further nuance. The palate delivers depth, weight, and textural complexity, and culminates in one final burst of fresh fruit.",

            "review": "This Two Stacks release enters bottle at a cask-strength 65 percent ABV, and comprises a blend of grain, pot still, and malt whiskeys. It spent the final days of its aging period in Tawny port casks, which provides attractive red reflections to its appearance, and ripe red berries to its bouquet. The whiskey's high proof serves to intensify the dark caramel notes and baking spices on its fiery palate, and prolong the finish to a minor eternity. While not for the faint of heart when sipped neat, a few drops of water will tame this enjoyable blend.",

Made at the brand’s Midleton microdistillery, this innovative whiskey contains a mash bill of 60 percent rye and 40 percent malted barley — a notable outlier if not downright unique in the space — which is double distilled and aged in ex-bourbon casks. A creamy, cereal-forward nose begins the experience, followed by a sweet palate that shines with bright stone fruit and spice. Bottled at 46 percent ABV, it delivers ample concentration without requiring dilution.",

A luscious, fruity palate awaits in glass, with ripe banana notes from the nose carrying through and mingling with rich sherry flavors as well as hints of spice and vanilla.

The flavor profile referenced in its name was achieved by finishing the single malt in rum and Pedro Ximenez sherry casks, the latter of which contribute dried fruit and nut notes. Beyond this tried and true flavor combo, prepare for generous servings of coconut, vanilla, and figs.",

            "review": "Crafted from a blend of triple-distilled whiskeys, this release combines five single malts, each of which aged in different types of barrel. One of the five malts (aged in bourbon casks) is peated, while another proportion of the blend aged in Imperial Stout casks. This combination, along with the three other components of the blend, yields an attractively smoky whiskey that's reminiscent of some of the finest malts from Islay, Scotland. Vanilla-poached pears dance with wafts of bonfire smoke on the nose. Meanwhile, the palate lands with a decadent richness, and complex flavors of dark chocolate, dried fruit, and oak. The finish is long, satisfying, and decidedly smoky..",

            "review": "After aging for 4 years in sherry casks, this single malt spent an unspecified finishing period in charred bog oak casks, an atypical vessel made from wood that has typically been buried and preserved in peat bogs. The unconventional aging environment has a notable influence on the final product, imbuing the whiskey with a distinctively oxidized and savory character that piques interest from the get-go. The deep orange hue of the whiskey is reflected in its flavor profile, with the single malt serving sour apple notes and a touch of honeysuckle on the nose, followed by a fruity and lively palate. Whether enjoyed neat or over ice, this whiskey screams summer sipper.",

            "review": "Single pot still releases represent a style that is truly unique to Ireland. What sets it apart from other whiskey styles is the inclusion of unmalted cereal grains in the mash bill, as well as the requirement that it be distilled and aged on the Emerald Isle. Despite the uniqueness of this style, single pot still whiskeys continue to garner less recognition than they deserve, which is puzzling, especially when considering the quality of bottles such as this. Redbreast 21 is a stunning whiskey that will take your breath away. As whiskeys age, we typically expect their profile to become more dried and concentrated. Instead, this pot still release has reached a point in its journey where those notes have turned around and returned to fresh, tropical fruit. The texture is unctuous and weighty, coating the palate with dense, concentrated sips. To say that the finish lingers is a gross understatement. Each sip continues for an age, evolving on palate and in the glass. Bravo!",

Honey and ripe fig aromas build about that character, while caramel and earthy malt notes on the palate set up a lasting finish.",

Any worries that it's a busy or confused combination are quickly put to rest upon tasting. This whiskey is focused and expressive, and serves rich, rounded helpings of fruit, sweetness, and spice.

The combination of age and the different cask influences arrive in perfect unison, with each component contributing to a dram that is even better than the sum of its parts. The nose is rich and intense, leading with notes of ripe banana, leather, cigar box, and tobacco. The palate serves luscious helpings of dried fruits, an unmistakable Oloroso sherry note, and a tingling peppery finish. Each sip is a special journey that you won't want to end — and for more than a fleeting moment, that seems to be the case. This is a graceful whiskey crafted for momentous occasions.",

The nose kicks off with subtle dried fruit and nut aromas, followed by a pleasant vanilla undertone. The palate is light-bodied and lively, but serves more depth on the flavor front than its light hue leads you to expect. This is perfect for summer sipping and whiskey highballs.",

            "review": "A stalwart in the single pot still category, Red Breast 12-year-old serves an easy-going, approachable intro to Ireland's traditional style of whiskey. Its inviting aromas start with dried fruits (apple crisps and golden raisins) then relay some subtle oak influence. The palate dials up the concentration considerably, with pronounced dried apricot and baking spice flavors, and a heavy mouthfeel that coats the palate. The depth of flavor means each sip lasts an age, but you'll soon be coming back for more.",

            "review": "Containing a blend of malted and unmalted barley in the mash bill, this pot still whiskey is triple distilled before it embarks on a long aging journey. That journey begins with a period of nine to 12 years resting in bourbon and sherry casks. A further, final resting period adds a special touch: One year in Oloroso sherry butts sourced from Bodegas Lustau. The double sherry influence doesn’t overwhelm the nose, though, with dried apricots, almonds, and a hint of vanilla instead driving the aromas. The palate is equally balanced, showing a lively mix of ripe stone fruit and nuts. The sherry cask influence fully presents itself on the finish, in the form of persisting sweet and savory flavors. This is wonderful.",

The unmalted part creates a spicy flavour and a creamy texture that allows it to stand apart from the flavour of single malt whiskey. It is distilled in a pot still.

Drioglann Oilean Acla, as their new home is officially named in the Irish language, is the first distillery to open on an island here. It also lies within the Gaeltacht, that part of Ireland where Irish is still the first language. Owned by the Irish American Trading Company, the distillery and its visitor centre will form part of the fledgling Gaeltacht Distillery Trail, as well as being a major tourist attraction in its own right.\n\nThese days, Achill is often approached along the 42 km greenway, which links the Atlantic island to Westport in County Mayo. The greenway was built along the route of a disused railway line and is a hugely popular cycling and walking trail, which cuts through some of the most dramatic landscape in the country.\n\nThe Irish American Trading Company, a family-owned business founded by John McKay in 2014, with offices in Dublin and Boston, invested some €4 million in the project. Its master distiller, David Hynes, is also a director of the Great Northern Distillery. Currently, they use sourced whiskey to produce their two whiskeys, which are already available in twenty-six US States."

            "Description": "Working distillery, visitor centre, and farm There are generations of experience behind the distillery at Ballykeefe in County Kilkenny, which is built on a working beef and tillage farm. Visitors here are likely to meet farmer Morgan Ging and his wife and four children personally, as they run these two perfectly complementary businesses in the heart of rural Ireland. You are also likely to meet their cattle. The farm outhouses were converted to house their three copper stills, which were handmade in Italy by another family business, Barison Industries. The water is their own and the barley is grown on site. Maturing happens here too, in first-fill bourbon barrels, making this one of the most environmentally aware, closed-loop distilleries in the country. They simply do it all themselves.\n\nThey&apos;ve already won more than thirteen international awards for their vodka, poitín, and gin, using the spirit they&apos;ve distilled since 2016. Their first whiskey is due for bottling in August 2020 but their most recent sample, tasted after nineteen months in barrel, has\n\nfuelled their confidence levels. They use only the highest cut of the distillate, they say, to ensure their whiskey will be extremely smooth, and this early taste is right on target. They have a single malt, a single pot still, and a 100 per cent rye whiskey under way, as well as various blends of this trio.\n\nBucking the trend of other distilleries, Ballykeefe chose not to launch a sourced-whiskey brand in advance, putting all their stock in their own hard work. Despite their whiskey not being available to taste yet, there&apos;s already a well-worn route to Ballykeefe by whiskey societies and individual whiskey fans. This ambitious family affair is a really positive addition to the Irish whiskey landscape, and well worth experiencing first hand for an alternative take on who is building the category."

So, becoming the twenty-first Irish whiskey distillery to start operating here, in November 2018, sparked lots of enthusiasm for what they might conjure.\n\nA quick glance at posts on their blog will drop you directly into a refreshing whirl of attitude and opinion on where the future of Irish whiskey is headed. They&apos;ve challenged themselves in this bright new world of Irish whiskey. Experimenting with maturation isn&apos;t enough for these trailblazers to start heralding a revolution, it seems. Instead, they want to create real distance between what they are creating and the rest of the field.\n\nThe people behind the distillery, founder and former broadcaster Peter Mulryan, Kieran Curtin, and the head\n\ndistiller, US-born John Wilcox, feel this can only be achieved through provenance. Is their whiskey truly Irish and, if so, what determines that? The barley, the water, the wood? Blackwater will be using block-chain technology on every bottle of their double-distilled whiskey so that the customer can scan and see the full production journey, including their use of Irish grains. They&apos;ll see where exactly they mature their spirit and the kind of wood they&apos;re using. The customer will get complete transparency. That shouldn&apos;t be such a radical idea, they suggest.\n\nThey&apos;ve built their business from scratch and appear to have garnered a real sense of who they are and where they want to go in doing so. They&apos;re ambitious for Irish whiskey and that&apos;s just the fuel they need."

Tours daily.\n\nThere aren&apos;t many distilleries in Ireland with a solid marble floor, but that was part of the luxury inheritance Boann received when they took up residence on their site in the Boyne valley, near Drogheda, on Ireland&apos;s east coast. The building that held the site before the stills arrived was a high-end car showroom and the floor laid for its cash-rich customers was too good to lose, they say. But then, the family behind this distillery are no strangers to a high-quality finish. They&apos;ve been involved in the drinks industry in Ireland for decades, running the Gleeson Group before setting up Boann&apos;s parent company Na Cuana, which also has premium cider, cream liqueur, and craft beer brands in its stable.\n\nTheir beer brand bookends the distillery, and visitors to the Boann Distillery&apos;s L-shaped building can continue their journey through the Boyne Brewhouse on the same site. Boann is named after an ancient Celtic female god, who is said to have created the\n\nnearby Boyne river, which carves out this historically important slice of the Irish landscape.\n\nThey currently use sourced whiskey as their own spirit matures, but you can expect experimental collaboration with their brewhouse in future releases. Plans to use their Imperial Stout casks in finishing their whiskey are already under way. With a close eye on the environment, the Italian engineers behind their stills have included enhanced reflux control on the neck to give better control over output, they say. Additionally, they reference the use of nanotechnology in the still design, creating the conditions for much greater interaction with the copper.\n\nThe location twenty-five minutes from Dublin Airport and just off a motorway exit means that the time-poor whiskey tourist eager to get out of Dublin is going to have Boann Distillery firmly in his or her sights.\n\nThey currently source whiskey for their Whistler range and aim to produce a future range of triple-distilled single malt and single pot stills under their own steam."

It&apos;s from a tributary of the same river Bush, called St Columb&apos;s Rill, that the Bushmills Distillery still takes its water today, and visitors marvel at how close they can get to a natural water source that is destined to be transformed into the core whiskeys that make up the Bushmills brand. Located just two kilometres from the dramatic Causeway Coast,\n\nthe distillery receives more than 120,000 visitors a year, making it one of the most popular tourist destinations in the region.\n\nBushmills has changed hands many times over the centuries before current owners, Mexican liquor brand Jose Cuervos, took up residence. Its previous owner, Diageo, spent a reputed €100 million modernizing and enlarging the distillery before selling it on. Each change of ownership brought with it the promise of a continued future for the brand and the many local people who are involved in its creation. But, regardless of who has been in charge at any given time, the identity of this truly Irish and Northern Irish brand has never quite been weakened, bringing a rich and exciting layer of experience to the Irish whiskey story."

The young distillery founded by Michael and Helen Scully is, not surprisingly, ambitious to join its famous older neighbour in the pursuit of perfectly-balanced flavours that take root in the landscape around them.\n\nThe distillery&apos;s story emerges at the point where the ocean meets the land surrounding the Galley Head lighthouse, 200 metres above the sea and a short drive from the town. It&apos;s a dramatic location, with the wind and waves of the wild Atlantic testing each generation of the Scully family that has tried to pull a living from the ground here.\n\nThe family are eighth-generation farmers, who had attempted to diversify their business a number of times before realizing the value of the barley they were growing from earth seeped in Atlantic sea salt and sand. An idea of a craft whiskey captured their imagination, and grew rapidly into a €10 million waterfront distillery in the town and a bonded warehouse on their land at the coast.\n\nHead distiller Paul Corbett returned to his home county from his role in Teeling Distillery in Dublin to oversee operations, and distilling began in March 2019. As they wait for their own triple-distilled single pot still spirit to mature they have launched the Clonakilty brand using sourced whiskey they have blended and matured."

The distillery&apos;s prime location on the Wild Atlantic Way ensures tourism is big business all year round, but also helps their whiskey maturation, they say. They rely on the salty coastal scent of the river at high and low tide, as well as the scents circulating from the trees and flowers of the woodlands to filter through their casks over time, bringing that little something extra to the wood.\n\nStill a young brand, Connacht Distillery ran its first spirit in January 2016. Time ticked by and they celebrated their first official whiskey three years and a day later, on\n\nJune 4th 2019. Master distiller Robert Cassell won&apos;t let you taste it just yet, though, as it has a few more years of maturing to do. Until then he plans to experiment with casks, finishes, and blends before releasing an aged statement single malt under the Connacht Irish Whiskey name.\n\nThe distillery was founded by a small group of American and Irish businessmen, family and friends. Apart from the Irish whiskey they are distilling, they produced a hybrid blend of American bourbon and Irish whiskey in Philadelphia called Brothership. Not quite Irish whiskey, not quite American bourbon, they see it as a celebration of journeys their families made back and forth across the Atlantic over generations."

No strangers to going it alone, they are also the people behind the Porterhouse group who redrew the map for craft beer decades before it became a trend here.\n\nDingle has capacity to distil only a small number of casks per day, a restricted quantity that has become a virtue among its fans, encouraging sell-out releases of its four batches among a public keen to collect. The first spirit was distilled in 2012 and it created award-winning\n\nbrands Dingle Gin and Dingle Vodka, while it quietly matured its single malt and pot still release.\n\nThe staff in the distillery exhibit real pride in their work, and it&apos;s hard to overestimate the difference the distillery has made to this close-knit tourist town, not just because of the employment it creates but in the shared sense of identity it conjures. It&apos;s a hard-working place, where things happen slowly and by hand: labelling, bottling, tending of casks, mashing.\n\nA well beneath the distillery supplies the water and Dingle&apos;s microclimate, with its salty, moist Atlantic air, works its magic beneath the wood. Stories bounce around the building and tours come stuffed with personality. A visit here is a genuinely inspiring event."

And the Derry man, who grew up in a pub before forging a career at Bushmills Distillery, will soon convince you that age truly is just a number. Although the striking cut-stone distillery at the heart of the Liberties only opened in 2019, they&apos;ve immediately cast off their start-up identity. Using sourced whiskey as their own spirit matures, they are already well established in major markets around the world, courtesy of their relationship with parent group Quintessential Brands.\n\nAlready anchored to the Liberties by its 400-year-old building, the people behind the DLD went a step further by dropping a 33-metre-deep well under the building to feed its production. The building was a former tannery that processed animal skins, including\n\nthe rabbit skins that were found during the DLD&apos;s €10 million renovation. It made sense then to take the brand name Dead Rabbit, which the group already owned, referencing the notorious New York-based Irish immigrant gang of the same name, and partner with their friends at the Dead Rabbit bar in Manhattan to produce the Dead Rabbit whiskey.\n\nOn the first floor of the DLD is a beautifully finished bar that runs the length of the building and overlooks their three copper stills. It&apos;s undoubtedly the best place to discover their story."

Created by John Teeling and his partners after the sale of the Cooley and Kilbeggan Distilleries to Beam Suntory, it is part of a relatively new economy built around contract distilling in bulk for other distilleries and third parties. This could include, for example, small distilleries that haven&apos;t yet matured their own spirit, it could be as a supplement to existing mature spirit, or it could be the whiskey source of independent brands that are bonding and blending their own whiskey, but not distilling.\n\nThroughout this book, distilleries will be referenced as using sourced whiskey. GND is one of only a very small number of distilleries with the capacity to be that source. It was set up in a former Diageo brewery that latterly brewed Harp Lager in the town of Dundalk. Its first three-year-old whiskey came of age in 2018.\nUsing water from the Cooley peninsula, it produces grain whiskey, triple-distilled malt whiskey, double- distilled malt whiskey, peated malt whiskey, and pot still whiskey. Its output is phenomenal - it has a current capacity of sixteen million litres of whiskey spirit. It also produces a poitín and a gin.\n\nIn addition to its bulk whiskey, in 2018 it launched an own-label whiskey called Burke&apos;s, a fifteen-year-old single cask bottled at 57.5 per cent, or natural cask strength.\n\nAs Great Northern Distillery is a large-scale production facility, it doesn&apos;t run tours."

It was first created in the late 1960s, in what many feared was the end game for Irish whiskey distilling. The industry was in severe decline, prompted by economic, political, and cultural shifts that impacted all areas of Irish industry, but whiskey in particular. Independent distilleries all around the country were falling silent and, in an act of self- preservation, three major distilleries merged.\n\nThe people behind the merger hoped that by combining their strengths they could forge a new future for their brands. The distilleries were Cork Distilleries Company, and the two Dublin distilleries, John Jameson and Son, and Powers and Son. (In 1972 Bushmills also joined Irish Distillers before being sold to Diageo in 2005.)\n\nNeither of the two Dublin distilleries offered the space needed to create a new distillery that could handle the output of all three, so the decision was made to close\n\nthe Dublin distilleries (Jameson at Bow Street and Powers at John&apos;s Lane) and move all their production to Midleton in Cork. The new Midleton Distillery opened in 1975 and thrives today.\n\nIrish Distillers is now the biggest distiller of Irish whiskey in the country, managing six major whiskey brands, each with a global outlook: Jameson, Powers, Redbreast, Method and Madness, Midleton VR, and the Spot range."

It was a strange sensation to witness a brand that I felt was so local, and even ordinary, be embraced by an audience as hip and international as the random sample I was experiencing. But such is the power of Jameson. It is by far the best-selling Irish whiskey globally, with sales reaching over seven million cases in 2018.\n\nOf course, Jameson is no stranger to the USA. It has been on the international market since the nineteenth century. It&apos;s also a whiskey with great lineage. It was founded in 1780 by a Scotsman, John Jameson, who with his wife Margaret Haig (the daughter of John Haig, another famous Scottish distiller) had sixteen children.\n\nIt is not surprising, then, to see Jameson have almost as many variants in its own whiskey family since.\n\nNow part of the Irish Distillers group, Jameson is distilled in the Midleton Distillery in Cork, a twenty-four-hour, seven days a week operation that can hardly pause for breath, such is the growth in demand. The old Jameson Distillery at Bow Street in Dublin is now a state-of-the art museum so, if you can&apos;t make it to Cork, you can still enjoy the full experience in the capital."

But every story you hear, whether about its new Cork home, its success around the globe, or the pot still flavours at its heart, will eventually cast your imagination back to Dublin, where it all began.\n\nPowers remains knitted into the fabric of the capital. You&apos;ll be startled at the sight of the original stills in what is now the National College of Art and Design (pictured), or realizing the underground car park on Drury Street is the former bottling hall, where (mostly) women worked, packaging and distributing the brand around the world. In the Victorian pubs of Dublin you&apos;ll find antique gold-leaf adorned Powers mirrors that have reflected Dublin life for over two hundred\n\nyears. And, in a bizarre twist, the Powers founder James Power, buried in 1817 in St James Graveyard on Thomas Street, has been knitted once again into the Irish whiskey story: the church building that casts a shadow across his grave has been converted into one of Dublin&apos;s youngest whiskey distilleries, the Pearse Lyons Distillery.\n\nThe people driving Powers today, under Irish Distillers and Pernod Ricard, recognize the value of this heritage and recently established the Powers Quarter in Dublin, essentially creating a district that is defined by Powers landmarks and a selection of Dublin bars that they hope can bring you to the heart of the brand."

With five siblings, this is a family of considerable distinction that has won almost every whiskey accolade in the world. The twelve-year-old Redbreast is the world&apos;s biggest-selling single pot still Irish whiskey.\n\nIt&apos;s the bedrock for a brand on continuous sale since 1912, when the then maker, W&amp;A Gilbey of London, decided to name its various Dublin-made pot still whiskeys after birds - reportedly prompted by his membership of the Royal Ornithological Society. By the 1980s Gilbey&apos;s was struggling and pot still whiskey was deeply out of fashion. Irish Distillers bought the label in 1984 but didn&apos;t start producing their own Redbreast until 1991.\n\nIrish whiskey fans are largely united in their respect for the brand, holding it in an almost romantic position in their minds. This is helped by the fact that this is a whiskey brand that somehow conjures up a sense of winter, or even Christmas, with roaring fires, crackling logs, and long, dark nights. While newer variants on\n\nthe original twelve-year-old have helped differentiate the brand from the colder months, it is still celebrated by Irish Distillers as something that anchors the winter season, with Christmas cake often heralded as a signature flavour in the signature twelve-year-old.\n\nThe combination of malted and unmalted barley in this single pot still creates the peppery, creamy sensation that defines Redbreast. Triple-distilled, it&apos;s matured in American oak from Kentucky and Tennessee and oloroso sherry barrels from Jerez in Spain. Incredibly smooth, it&apos;s recommended that you drink it neat.\n\nThe latest adventure in the Redbreast range is Redbreast Dream Cask, a very limited-edition release of thirty-two- year-old single pot still that really took the world by storm.

Additional products have been added since. There&apos;s no room in the whiskey business for regret, it seems, so they&apos;ve created something for everyone.\n\nIrish Distillers know better than most what the success of Jameson did for the Irish whiskey market internationally. As satisfying as it is to see millions of litres of whiskey production flow through their distillery each year, master distiller Brian Nation knows that, for customers, graduating from Jameson can&apos;t be about simply picking the next bottle from the shelf. He and his team plan to keep that graduate buyer firmly in the family and while their niche connoisseur brands, like Redbreast, the Spot range, and Midleton Very Rare, do a great job at\n\nthat, he says, getting the opportunity to create a whole new range at a price point that&apos;s accessible is crucial.\n\nThe method and the madness in its name reference the distillery&apos;s masters and apprentices who collaborated on the range, using expert knowledge to drive fresh new ideas while also training a whole new generation of distillers, blenders, and coopers. It&apos;s a strong angle to forge a new brand and its core range plus special limited-edition casks have caught the attention of both new young drinkers and seasoned fans looking for something new."

It was a simpler time, when the noble art of blending and bonding whiskey was just part of the whiskey landscape. Mitchell &amp; Son were wine and spirit merchants, who used sherry and port casks they had imported to fashion a whole new flavour profile, using Jameson sourced from the then working distillery of Bow Street. The spots and their respective colours came from the Mitchell family&apos;s habit of marking casks of different ages - Blue for seven years, Green for ten years, Yellow for twelve years, and Red for fifteen years. legions\n\nMore than a century later, the whiskey is just as celebrated. Still created for Mitchell &amp; Son, it is distilled and matured in Midleton Distillery in Cork as part of Irish Distillers. Rich and spicy, each pot still is a different age and recipe. Blue spot remains waiting in the wings to be revived but the other three colours are each back\n\non the shelves. Red Spot re-emerged to great fanfare last year and immediately sold out. Green Spot, which is the only one that has been continuously distilled since the beginning, has two additional variants, forging even more meaningful connections."

Beam Suntory bought the Cooley and Kilbeggan distilleries in 2012.\n\nCooley now does the majority of the distilling for their three brands, Kilbeggan, Connemara, and Tyrconnell whiskeys. The Kilbeggan Distillery produces its own rye whiskey in its two pot stills just off the distillery courtyard, and matures spirit from Cooley for the Kilbeggan range in its warehouses.\n\nIt&apos;s a fascinating place to visit, offering one of the clearest experiences of what a working distillery would have\n\nbeen like at the height of the Irish whiskey boom. Before it was bought, local people had taken it upon themselves to save the building and the great water wheel that drives the mill was central to their plan to bring this historic building at the heart of the town back to life. On a tour you&apos;re brought through the building and you get to see the water wheel and the then cutting-edge machinery that it powered. It&apos;s a powerful testament to naturally derived power. But, perhaps more importantly, what the local people saved and Cooley restored is a wonderful record of the simplicity of whiskey production."
